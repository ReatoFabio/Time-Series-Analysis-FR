##*Time Series Conclusion:*
#-ARMA and ARIMA model have p-values higher than 0.05 which means the variables are statically non-significant. According to GARCH model, the risk is going to increase in the past. I would not trade using this model

##*Linear Regression Analysis:*
-Out-of-Sample Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.41545437184712763
-In-sample Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.5962037920929946
In sample RMSE is higher than the Out of Sample RMSE, which means that our model does not overfit in the training data. The model did good!
